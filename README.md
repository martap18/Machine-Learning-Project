# Machine-Learning-Project

Machine Learning project developed as part of the Machine Learning course, focused on predicting car prices using regression models.
The analysis includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model benchmarking (Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, SVR), and hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV.
Results show that ensemble methods outperform linear models, with the Random Forest achieving the best predictive performance (R² ≈ 0.93).
